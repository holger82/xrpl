# xrpl
inspired by https://xrpl-adventure.netlify.app/ 

I wanted to provide an implementation that is a little more flexible regarding input and output. 

this is my very first attempt with python so I am sure there is place to improve.

The script used ripple mainnet api and coinstats api for the calculation.

To get started:

* Clone the repo
* cp .env.template .env
* setup your .env file
* run the script with python3 xrpl.py
* Result is in out/json_result.json
